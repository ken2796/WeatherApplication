You will find my weather application there. Open the file and click on the blue file named "WeatherApplication.swift". Take note: you can open it in Visual Studio, but you won't be able to run it. You need to download Xcode. Once downloaded, click the WeatherApplication file, then click View, and you'll see the preview of the app I created. To run it on the simulator, first check which device you want to use, then build the project.
